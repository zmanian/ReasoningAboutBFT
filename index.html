					BFT consensus is essential for Tor, Bitcoin, & other cryptocurrencies 
					</section>

						BFT consensus lets have consistent sytems when
						<ul>
							<li>Some of the computers are controlled by the adversary</li>
							<li>The network is acting against us</li>
						</ul>

						Bitcoin is special. Demonstrated the possibility of consensus at Internet scale.

						<h3>New protocols are appearing at an increasing rate</h3>
						<h3>How do you tell if these things are secure? What does secure even mean?</h3>

					<section>
						Reading BFT paper is really hard.
						Every paper describes a complicated state machine.

						Let's talk about BFT in different terms.
					</section>
					<section data-background="network.png">
						Pretend you are peer. You are looking for evidence that a message from the network is safe to accept.
					</section>
					<section>
						Peers must evaluate the messages they recieve for evidence of the following.
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li> Was this message originated honestly?</li>
							<li> Do other peers see the same message as I am?</li>
							<li> Is the equal or better competition to this message? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						It is a powerful techique to re-interpret the state machine of consensus algorithim as system for producing evidence of correct operation of the system
					</section>
					<section>
						
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					Let's Explore How Several Consensus Protocols produce this evidence.
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Bitcoin's Proof of Work</li>
						<li>Tendermint</li>
						<li>Honeybadger</li>
					</ul>

					Every Protocol has safety limits when exceeded the evidence becomes meaningless.

						Proof of Work/ Nakamoto Consensus (2008)
						<br>
						 by 
						Satoshi Nakamoto
					</section>
					<section>
						Rule:
						<br>
						Discover the most work chain.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anonynmous consensus
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of correct message generation.
						<br>
						Translated in to a number the block header hash is below the threshold.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of network broadcast.
						<br>
						Future messages that extend the current block are evidence that message was dissemeniated.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of competing messages.
						<br>
						Evidence is probalistic and declines as new consistent messages are found.
					</section>

					</section>
					<section>
						Safety: 51% of hashing power is honest.
