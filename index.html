					BFT consensus is essential for Tor, Bitcoin, & other cryptocurrencies 
					</section>
					<section>
						BFT consensus lets have consistent sytems when
						<br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Some of the computers are controlled by the adversary</li>
							<li>The network is acting against us</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
					Without BFT,<br/>
						<ul>
							<li> An attacker could force Tor users onto attacker controlled routes </li>
							<li> An attacker could trick a user user into thinking Bitcoin had been transferred </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>New protocols are appearing at an increasing rate</h3>
						<h3>How do you tell if these things are secure? What does secure even mean?</h3>

						Reading BFT paper is really hard.
						Every paper describes a complicated state machine.

						Let's talk about BFT in different terms.

					<section data-background="network.png" data-state="dimbg" >
						Pretend you are peer. You are looking for evidence that a message from the network is safe to accept.
					</section>
					<section>
						Peers must evaluate the messages they recieve for evidence of the following.
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li> Was the message created by an authorized user?</li>
							<li> Do other peers see the same message as I am?</li>
							<li> Is the equal or better competition to this message? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
					Interpreting BFT proposals in this fashion provides a baseline.

					Liveness vs Safety
					<br/>
					I'm going to focus on safety. 				
				</section>
				
				
				
				<section>
					Let's Explore How Several Consensus Protocols produce this evidence.
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Bitcoin's Proof of Work</li>
						<li>Tendermint</li>
						<li>Honeybadger</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					Every Protocol has safety limits when exceeded the evidence becomes meaningless.
				</section>
				<section>
					Consensus protocols must provide 3 kinds of evidence to achieve basic safety.
					<ul>
						<li> Proof of correct block generation </li>
						<li> Proof of block distribution</li>
						<li> Proof of uniqueness </li>
					</ul>

						Proof of Work/ Nakamoto Consensus (2008)

						 by 
						Satoshi Nakamoto
					</section>
					<section>
						Consensus in a slide.
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Manipulate free values in a block of message until bignum(hash(block)) < threshold </li>
							<li>If when peer find a competing block at a given height, compare the total of the bignums and choose the smallest </li>	
						</ul>	
					</section>	

					<section>
						Anonynmous consensus. There is no PKI for consensus particpants.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of correct message generation.
						<br>
						Translated in to a number the block header hash is below the threshold.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of network broadcast.
						<br>
						As future new correct blocks are generated, users become inceasingly confident that a block was disseminated.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of competing messages.
						<br>
						As total work in a chain increases, it become difficult but no impossible for another chain to exist.
					</section>
					<section>
						Safety: 51% of hashing power is honest.

					Tendermint (2014)

					by
					Jae Kwon
					</section>
					<section>
							Consensus in a slide.
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Leader for a time segment is deterministically psuedo randomly selected</li>
							<li> Blocks becomes valid after 2/3rds of validators have signed the block as correct</li>	
						</ul>
					</section>	
					<section>
					Simplicity is Tendermint's main virtue.
					</section>
					<section>
						Evidence of correct message generation.
						<br>
						Block generated by the deterministically elected leader
					</section>
						<section>
							Evidence of network broadcast.
							<br>
							Witness signatures from 2/3rd of validator network
						</section>
						<section>
							Evidence of competing messages.
							<br>
							2/3rds of the network must collude to generate a competing message

						Consensus in a slide
		`			<ul>
						<li> Generate a threshold descryption key. </li>
						<li> Send a encrypted tx, key share and sig to other validators.</li>
						<li> When a validator can decrypt a block, blockcast for witness signatures</li>
						<li> Acccumulate 2/3rds of witness signatures </li>
					</ul>
